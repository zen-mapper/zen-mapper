    Protocol for a cover

    A set is represented as a numpy array of indices into the original data
    set. For instance `[0, 4, 3]` represents the set with the 0th, 4th, and 3rd
    elements from the original dataset. A cover is a collection of these sets.
    It is expected that these cover the dataset however no effort is made to
    enforce this constraint.

    Specifcially we require that you can iterate over the sets in the cover and
    that you can report the number of cover elements. In particular this means
    a list of arrays or a set of arrays will work. It is unlikely that you will
    actually implement this protocol, what you probably want is

    do not enforce closure propreties for these simplicial complexes. This

    is not valid because the element at index `0` appears in multiple arrays.

    In addition to the partition, the clusterer also produces metadata.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Mapper now takes a `min_intersection` parameter to allow specifying the
  overlap in the nerve.
- `zen_mapper.cover.precomputed_cover` was added which allows specifying a
  precomputed cover instead of a cover scheme.

### Change

- The cover protocol previously required being an iterable of numpy arrays.
  This was loosened to allow for iterables of anything which is convertible to
  a numpy array.

### Fixed

- `sk_learn` cluster adapter no longer panics if given a dataset with 1 element

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-28

### Added

- The `n_elements` parameter for `Width_Balanced_Cover` now allows for a
  different number of `n_elements` to be set per axis.

### Change

- Added support for python 3.10
- Mark python 3.10 as the minimum version.

### Added

- overlay for nixpkgs

### Fixed

### Fixed

## [0.1.3] - 2023-12-05

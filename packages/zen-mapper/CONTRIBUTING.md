# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in zen-mapper! Here are a couple of notes on how to
contribute.

## Something seems wrong

If something seems wrong please do not hesitate to open up an
[issue](/issues/new) here on github. Issues are also the best way to ask
questions about zen-mapper. All we ask is before doing so check to make sure
that your questions is not covered by our incredibly sparse
[documentation](https://zen-mapper.github.io/zen-mapper/).

## Contributing code

The general pipeline for getting code added to zen-mapper is as follows:

1. [fork zen-mapper](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
2. [create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
3. write your code
4. [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

Before submitting a new feature it is wise to open an issue discussing the
proposed feature to make sure that there is interest first. Beyond that we can
hash everything out during the review process. What follows are tips on how to
develop code for zen-mapper and requirements for getting a change merged. Don't
worry too much about following these to the letter, that's what the review
process is for.

### Developer Environment

If you already use [nix](https://nixos.org) the easiest way to get up and
running is to run `nix develop` which will drop you into a shell with
everything you need. We use [just](https://just.systems) as our task runner,
running `just` will list all the tasks you can run.

If you don't use nix, we provide files for using uv to manage your environment.
Instructions on how to do that can be found
[here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/).

### Architectural Design Decisions

If your change includes a design choice which addresses a requirement which is
architecturally significant a brief description of why your choice was made
will need to be added to the decision log in `docs/source/decisions`. These
descriptions should follow the [MADR 4.0.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/) spec.
There are templates in `docs/source/decisions` for you to use. Do not worry
about this too much if opening a PR, if one is needed it will be mentioned
before merging and it will probably encode whatever discussion in the issues or
pull request led to the decision being made.
